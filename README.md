## RepositoriesApp

### Overview

`RepositoriesApp` is an iOS application that allows users to search for GitHub repositories using a search bar. The app fetches repository data from the GitHub API and displays the results in a table view. The app is built using the MVVM architecture pattern, and it utilizes `RxSwift` for reactive programming, making the codebase more maintainable and responsive.

---

### Features

- Search for GitHub repositories using a `UISearchBar`.
- Display repository search results in a `UITableView`.
- Handle errors and provide user feedback through alerts.
- Implement debounce (throttle) to reduce API calls while typing in the search bar.

### Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for iOS app development.
- **UIKit**: Used for building the user interface, including `UIViewController`, `UISearchBar`, and `UITableView`.
- **RxSwift**: A reactive programming framework used to handle asynchronous events, manage state, and bind data between the view and the view model.
- **RxCocoa**: A framework that extends `RxSwift` to work seamlessly with Cocoa components like `UISearchBar` and `UITableView`.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The architecture pattern used to separate concerns between the UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data handling (Model).

### File Structure

- **`RepoServiceApi.swift`**:
  - This file defines the `RepoServiceApi` class and the `RepoServiceApiProtocol`. It handles the network requests to the GitHub API and returns the parsed data in the form of a `RepoModel`. Error handling is also managed here, with custom errors defined in the `RepoError` enum.

- **`RepoViewModel.swift`**:
  - The `RepoViewModel` class is responsible for interacting with the `RepoServiceApi` to fetch data based on user input. It exposes observable properties (`repoItems` and `errorHandling`) using `RxSwift`'s `BehaviorSubject` to keep track of the repository data and any errors that might occur during the data fetching process.

- **`RepoViewController.swift`**:
  - The `RepoViewController` class is the main view controller of the app. It contains a `UISearchBar` for user input and a `UITableView` to display the search results. It binds the user input and view model data using `RxSwift` and `RxCocoa`, allowing the UI to update reactively based on user actions and fetched data. The view controller also manages the display of alerts for error handling.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RepositoriesApp.git
   ```
   
2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `RepositoriesApp.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Ensure your development environment is set up with Xcode and the necessary dependencies.
   - Build the project and run it on a simulator or a physical device.

4. **Search for Repositories**:
   - Type a search query into the search bar.
   - The app will fetch and display the GitHub repositories that match your query.

5. **Handle Errors**:
   - If there are any issues with fetching data, the app will display an alert with the error message.

### Error Handling

- **`badUrl`**: Indicates that the URL provided for the API request is invalid. The user will see an alert with the message: "The URL provided is invalid. Please check the URL and try again."
- **`badServerResponse`**: This error occurs when the server's response is unexpected (e.g., non-200 status code). The user will be informed via an alert: "The server response was not as expected. Please try again later."
- **`failedFetchData`**: If the app fails to fetch data from the API (e.g., network issues), an alert will display: "Failed to fetch data. Please check your internet connection or try again later."

---

### Dependencies

- **RxSwift**: Ensure you have installed the RxSwift and RxCocoa pods if youâ€™re using CocoaPods. Add the following to your `Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  pod 'RxSwift', '~> 6.0'
  pod 'RxCocoa', '~> 6.0'
  ```

- **Xcode**: Make sure you are using a recent version of Xcode that supports Swift 5.7 or later.
